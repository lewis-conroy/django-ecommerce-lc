# Django 'Crafty Devil' e-commerce web application.
This is a django web app which I created while learning how to use the Django web app framework.

Utilises Django, Bootstrap as well as some auxilliary libraries like ssl, smtplib, and paypal.

The application is a fairly standard e-commerce site, customers can create accounts and view their past orders etc. Admin accounts can create, read, update and delete all records in the database in a CRUD style admin page (not the pre-made django admin page).

Paypal is enabled on the site and customers receive an email upon completing their order.
